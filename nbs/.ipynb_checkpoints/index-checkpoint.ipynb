    "#### Features:\n",
    "- human-readable proofs that run in code. Clear from each line what is being achieved mathematically.\n",
    "- Pure python. Duck typing and abstracts allow for quick end-to-end proof designs, only implementing what you need.\n",
    "- Relies on python abstractions you know, like the type system for defining input and output types\n",
    "- Great, human readable errors so it's clear where your logic is breaking down, why, how you might fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principles\n",
    "- Minimal abstractions, small API\n",
    "- minimal dependencies (just sympy right now)\n",
    "- declarative, functional api\n",
    "- simple to use\n",
    "- batteries included"
